Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from nodejs.org. To check if you have them installed, run the following commands in your terminal:


node -v - to find the version


npm -v

Step 2: Create a New React App
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your portfolio app. For example:


cd path/to/your/directory
Use Create React App to set up a new React project. Run:


npx create-react-app my-portfolio
Replace my-portfolio with your desired project name.
Step 3: Navigate to Your Project
Once the setup is complete, navigate into your project folder:


cd my-portfolio
Step 4: Start the Development Server
You can start the development server to see your app in action:


npm start
This will open your app in the default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
